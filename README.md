# WhatsApp-Subject-Analyser
A quick python GUI project I made to find all the different subject changes in an exported chat.

Example of an exported Whatsapp chat:
```
01/01/1970, 00:01 - Alice: How is everyone finding 2038?
01/01/1970, 00:02 - Bob changed the subject from Foo to Bar
```

This was partially made to see all the changes to the subject in a WhatsApp chat and partially to make a tkinter-based GUI.
